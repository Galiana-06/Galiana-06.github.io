    <h2>Meet the Characters</h2>
    <div class="a1"> <img id="elena" src="photos/elena.jpg" alt="Elena">
        <p id="elenap">Elena is a young mage with a thirst for knowledge and a heart full of courage. She possesses a
            keen intellect and
            a natural talent for magic, honed through years of study and practice at the Academy of Arcane Arts. With
            her
            fiery red hair and piercing green eyes, she cuts a striking figure, her confidence and determination evident
            in
            every step she takes. Beneath her confident exterior lies a compassionate soul, always ready to lend a
            helping
            hand to those in need. As she embarks on her quest for the Lost Tome of Eldoria, she finds herself tested in
            ways she never imagined, but her indomitable spirit and unwavering resolve carry her through even the
            darkest of
            times.</p>

    <div class="a1"><img id="thorne" src="photos/thorne.jpg" alt="Thorne">
        <p id="thornep">Thorne is a seasoned adventurer with a quick wit and a sharp blade. With his rugged good looks
            and easy smile, he
            has a way of charming his way out of trouble and into the hearts of those he meets. Born and raised on the
            streets of the bustling city of Eldoria, he learned from an early age to rely on his instincts and his
            street
            smarts to survive. But beneath his roguish exterior lies a heart of gold, fiercely loyal to his friends and
            unafraid to stand up for what he believes in. As he joins Elena on her quest for the Lost Tome of Eldoria,
            he
            finds himself drawn into a world of magic and mystery unlike anything he's ever known, but with Elena by his
            side, he knows that together they can overcome any challenge that comes their way.</p>

            the Forbidden Ruins. He appears in the culmination of the story when Elena and Thorne reach the heart of the
